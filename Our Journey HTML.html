    <h>Our Journey In Finding The Need For Streaming</h>
    <p>We made our group portfolio on 09-02-2021. The journey to find the need for streaming required us to define, ideate, and empathize. After researching, learning, and knowing the 5 design thinking process, we made types of content that can be helpful to people or our viewers if ever we decide to stream.


        Before finding out how to identify the needs of stream viewers, we needed to know what streaming is, and based on our research, streaming is the digital process of accessing and/or browsing of media as it is being transmitted in real-time.
        
        Aside from this, we also needed to experience streaming and watching them to be able to understand streaming further.
        
        
        During our journey, we also realized that empathizing and empathy is very important not only in this world but also in relating and finding the need for something. It allows us to understand things further and sometimes even deeper.
        
        Adding to this, we have also learned that streaming, or live streaming specifically, requires good gear and technology to achieve without any problems. You need a good internet connection, a good microphone, a good camera (if you are doing face cam), a good device (PC is recommended), and good overlays.
        
        We have identified what is actually considered relevant in the streaming community along with its importance and how its general audience tends to think.

        Here are some of the things we learned along the way:

        <li>TV</li>
    <p>
        Every bit of streaming has been researched to find out why it is important.
        
        Streaming is important not only because it allows people to enjoy media with less inconveniences. It also allows people to socialize and connect with each other. It’s an outlet for everybody to express and contribute. It is an integral part of our modern, interconnected, and globalized society.
