    <h2 style="line-height: 80px; padding-inline: 20px;">I. Summary of Stream - Ahmed Ahmed Salem Ahmed Illescas</h2>

<p>The live stream that we conducted on 2/24/22 was a gaming (Valorant) and discussion type of live stream. Our aim was to have a light-hearted and chill gaming and Discord session, not only for our and our audience’s entertainment, but also for our analysis of the game which we love, and for our viewers to hopefully gain newfound knowledge.</p>


<h2 style="line-height: 80px; padding-inline: 20px;">II. Strengths of Our Stream - Luigi Miguel C. Gonzales</h2>

<p>There are 3 strengths of our stream which was why it was enjoyable for us and the people behind the stream and the audiences as well. Firstly, we were able to make our stream properly without any technical issues so that the audience wouldn't get bored and would not be interrupted while watching our stream. Secondly, we were able to entertain our audience with our awkward conversations and the game we played which was Valorant which is a very popular game right now. Lastly, we were able to avoid any DMCA (confirmed by Twitch itself) violation so our stream was good and safe.</p>

<p>A number of our viewers were engaged in our live stream, commenting in chat and requesting shoutouts.

<h2 style="line-height: 80px; padding-inline: 20px;">V. Analysis of the Viewership of Our Stream - Luigi Miguel C. Gonzales, Ahmed Ahmed Salem Ahmed Illescas</h2>

<p>With the context that the channel’s follower count (as of 3/3/22) is only 17, the stream did well. We had a total of 107 viewers. We were only expecting some people to watch our stream with around 10-20 people, but needless to say, the viewership of our stream is very high. We also maintained their presence in the live stream, with them staying long before leaving, or even until the stream actually ended.</p>
